# Learn

Four key steps to learn a technique.

1. Select a concept and map your knowledge
1. Teach it to a 12-year-old
1. Review and refine
1. Test and archive

## Step 1 Select a concept and map your knowledge

Start with a blank page. Write everything you know about your chosen topic.

## Explain it to a 12-year-old

## Review and refine

When you find weak spots, return to the source material. Study those sections
until you can explain them simply.

## Test and Archive

Test your understanding by teaching someone else. Once satisfied, archive your simple
explanation in a learning binder for periodic review.
