# Work

* **Focus** - Eliminate distractions:
  - Keep a clean desk with minimal items
  - Use fewer tools to avoid context switching
  - Find quiet spaces away from notifications and conversations
  - Avoid multi-tasking
  - Block 1-2 hours for focused work, then take breaks

* **Energy Management** - Identify your peak hours when you're most alert (typically 2-4 hours after waking) and schedule demanding work during these times. Work in 90-120 minute cycles with 15-20 minute breaks to match your natural energy rhythms.

* **Reflection** - Periodically improve the process by reprioritizing work and finding ways to further improve efficiency.
