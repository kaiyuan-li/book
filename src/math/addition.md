# Addition

Addition is one of the fundamental mathematical operations. It combines two or more numbers into a single number, called the sum or total.

## Symbol

The addition symbol is "+". For example:
- 2 + 3 = 5
- 7 + 8 = 15

## Properties

1. **Commutative Property**: The order of numbers doesn't matter
   - a + b = b + a
   - Example: 3 + 4 = 4 + 3 = 7

2. **Associative Property**: How numbers are grouped doesn't matter
   - (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
   - Example: (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9

3. **Identity Property**: Adding zero to any number gives the same number
   - a + 0 = a
   - Example: 5 + 0 = 5

## Common Applications in Minecraft

1. **Resource Collection**: Adding items from different sources
   - Steve collected 43 coals from mining underground and made 41 coals from burning wood in furnaces. 
     * 43 coals + 41 coals = 84 coals total
   - Alex found 24 iron ores in a cave and another 13 iron ores while strip mining.
     * 24 iron ores + 13 iron ores = 37 iron ores total

2. **Building Materials**: Calculating total blocks needed
   - To build a house, you need 45 oak planks for the walls and 32 oak planks for the roof.
     * 45 planks + 32 planks = 77 oak planks total
   - For a castle wall, you used 128 stone blocks for the first layer and 64 stone blocks for the second layer.
     * 128 blocks + 64 blocks = 192 stone blocks total

3. **Combat**: Adding up damage points
   - Your diamond sword deals 7 damage points and the sharpness enchantment adds 3 damage points.
     * 7 points + 3 points = 10 damage points total
   - You hit a zombie twice, each hit dealing 5 damage points.
     * 5 points + 5 points = 10 damage points total

## Techniques

### Making Tens

Making tens is a mental math technique commonly used in East Asian countries. It involves regrouping numbers to make tens, which are easier to work with.

For example, to add 8 + 7:
1. First, identify how much more 8 needs to make 10 (it needs 2)
2. Take 2 from 7, leaving 5
3. Now we have 10 + 5 = 15

More examples:
- 9 + 6
  * 9 needs 1 to make 10
  * Take 1 from 6, leaving 5
  * 10 + 5 = 15

- 7 + 8
  * 7 needs 3 to make 10
  * Take 3 from 8, leaving 5
  * 10 + 5 = 15
