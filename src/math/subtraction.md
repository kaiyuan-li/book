# Subtraction

Subtraction is one of the fundamental mathematical operations. It finds the difference between two numbers by taking away one number from another.

## Symbol

The subtraction symbol is "-". For example:
- 5 - 3 = 2
- 15 - 7 = 8

## Properties

1. **Non-Commutative Property**: The order of numbers matters
   - a - b ≠ b - a
   - Example: 7 - 4 = 3, but 4 - 7 = -3

2. **Non-Associative Property**: How numbers are grouped matters
   - (a - b) - c ≠ a - (b - c)
   - Example: (10 - 5) - 2 = 3, but 10 - (5 - 2) = 7

3. **Identity Property**: Subtracting zero from any number gives the same number
   - a - 0 = a
   - Example: 5 - 0 = 5

## Common Applications in Minecraft

1. **Resource Management**: Tracking remaining resources
   - Steve had 64 iron ingots and used 38 to craft tools.
     * 64 ingots - 38 ingots = 26 iron ingots remaining
   - Alex collected 50 diamonds but spent 24 on armor.
     * 50 diamonds - 24 diamonds = 26 diamonds remaining

2. **Building Materials**: Calculating remaining blocks
   - You have 128 cobblestone blocks and used 75 for a wall.
     * 128 blocks - 75 blocks = 53 blocks remaining
   - Started with 64 oak planks and used 47 for a house.
     * 64 planks - 47 planks = 17 planks remaining

3. **Combat**: Calculating remaining health
   - A zombie has 20 health points and takes 8 damage from your sword.
     * 20 points - 8 points = 12 health points remaining
   - Your armor has 100 durability points and takes 35 damage from falls.
     * 100 points - 35 points = 65 durability points remaining
