# Central Retinal Vein Obstruction

## Terminologies

* **edema**: swelling due to fluid buildup

* **Etiology**: the cause or origin of disease or condition

* **ischemic**: ischemic refers to a condition caused by restricted blood flow to a
part of the body, usually due to blockage in blood vessels. This lack of blood flow
reduces oxygen supply to tissues, which can lead to damage or dysfunction.

* **macula**: The macula is the cental part of the retina, located at the back of the
eye. It is responsible for sharp, detailed central vision and color perception. The
macula contains a high concentration of cone photoreceptor cells, which help in
recognizing fine details, such as reading, recognizing faces and seeing colors vividly.

## Diagnostic Evaluation

* Intravenous fluorescein angiography: This is to inject fluorescein dye into a vein,
which then travels to the blood vessels in the retina. Normally the dye fills the
arteries first, then veins without delay. A delay in retinal venous filling sugests an
issue with blood flow through the veins, which is commonly seen in conditions like
CRVO. Intra-retinal leakage of dye means that the blood vessels are leaking fluid into
the retina, which is a sign of vascular damage or breakdown of the blood-retinal
barrier.

* OCT: reveals the presence or absense of macular edema. PAMM (paracentral accute
middle maculopathy, a specific OCT finding that indicates ischemia affecting the
deep capillary plexus) is a sign of retinal ischemia.
